Manifest for Symbiotic Human–AI Governance
Towards Functional Democracy and Measurable Economic Justice

1. Context
Modern democracy faces structural exhaustion. Formal mechanisms of representation, while procedurally legitimate, have become vulnerable to economic capture, informational manipulation, and decision-making populism.
Simultaneously, the systemic challenges of the 21st century — economic inequality, ecological degradation, and technological concentration — exceed the coordination capacity of current political institutions.
This discrepancy generates a dual crisis: a legitimacy crisis and a competence crisis, together creating a governance crisis.

2. Problem
Contemporary democratic systems rely almost exclusively on political selection through majority voting, without robust and continuous mechanisms for ethical, cognitive, and impact-based qualification.
Without such mechanisms, the democratic process allows the rise of leaders who may excel in electoral competition but do not necessarily demonstrate the moral capacity, competence, or orientation toward the common good required for responsible governance.
Structural consequences include:
* incoherent economic decisions;
* reactive and fragmented policies;
* progressive separation between power and responsibility.
Correcting these deviations depends almost exclusively on slow and easily manipulable electoral cycles, while the effects of decisions accumulate quickly and often irreversibly.

3. Principle of Change
Governance must evolve from formal democracy to functional democracy.
This transition introduces a model of Symbiotic Human–AI Governance, in which:
* artificial intelligence provides systemic analysis, coherence, and transparency;
* human decision-making remains but is constrained by verified data, continuous evaluation, and measurable impact.
Artificial intelligence does not replace human decision-making and holds no political sovereignty. Its role is to limit opacity, arbitrariness, and informational distortion, amplifying human capacity to govern responsibly.

4. Proposal: Transition in Two Phases
4.1 Phase I – Transitional Governance (national level)
In the first phase, a mechanism for qualifying and validating political candidates is introduced, complementary to the existing electoral process.
* Candidate lists are validated through Human–AI mechanisms based on:
o ethical and altruistic behavior demonstrated over the long term;
o verifiable altruistic acts involving real personal cost;
o public service history and documented social impact.
* Validation is carried out by transparent and auditable AI systems in collaboration with independent human expert groups.
* Citizens retain full voting rights over ethically and competently qualified options.
* The duration of the transitional phase is not fixed in time but depends on the society’s comfort and familiarity with the principles of Symbiotic Human–AI Governance. It will continue until the mechanisms for candidate selection and leader evaluation are perceived as transparent, effective, and naturally integrated into the democratic process.
The purpose of this phase is to improve the quality of political representation without suspending democratic legitimacy.

4.2 Phase II – Global Symbiotic Governance
In the second phase, a functional global coordination framework is established through the Council of the United Nations (C.N.U.), an executive global body with a limited and clearly defined mandate.
* The C.N.U. operates in partnership with AI systems for analysis, simulation, and coordination.
* Its mandate is limited to transnationally significant domains, such as:
o global economic coordination;
o climate policies;
o ethical and transparency standards.
* National sovereignty is maintained but explicitly linked to global responsibility.

5. Human–AI Protocol for Selecting and Evaluating Political Leaders
5.1 Qualification and Validation
Candidate evaluation is based on cross-verified data, avoiding self-reporting, uncorrelated electoral promises, and unjustified public image capital.
5.2 Public Transparency
* AI evaluation methodologies are public, documented, and independently auditable.
* Candidate profiles, evaluation indicators, and relevant histories are accessible to citizens.
5.3 Continuous and Comparative Evaluation
* Elected leaders are continuously and comparatively evaluated through social, economic, and ecological impact indicators.
* Political performance becomes measurable, verifiable, and benchmarked, not merely declarative.

6. Fundamental Ethical Principles
* AI systems used in governance are open-source, auditable, and revocable.
* No AI-generated or recommended decision becomes mandatory without explicit human validation.
* Citizens retain the right to revoke elected representatives through transparent mechanisms.
* Decision-making transparency, financial flows, and deliberative processes are the rule, not the exception.

7. Economic Justice
Symbiotic governance does not automatically deliver economic justice.
It does, however, create for the first time the structural conditions under which economic injustice cannot be maintained without becoming visible, contestable, and correctable.
By reducing decision-making opacity and continuously evaluating the real impact of policies, the distribution of costs and benefits becomes transparent and subject to correction.

8. Conclusion
Symbiotic Human–AI Governance is neither a technological utopia nor a delegation of power to algorithms. It is a continuous correction architecture, intended to restore competence, responsibility, and coherence in governance.
This proposal does not offer perfect solutions but provides a functional framework for adaptation, learning, and systemic correction in an increasingly complex world.
